This is a basic React frontend application, resembling Splitwise, designed to display optimal transactions by minimizing the number of exchanges needed. Currently, there is no database integration, and expenses are not stored permanently, also the mobile view had not been added yet but still you can open this in phone and use it. The application is intended for calculating final transactions, indicating how much each person owes another, after a group of friends has incurred expenses together, such as during a trip.

To use this just clone the repository and install all the dependencies using command: 
"npm install" 

after installing all the dependencies write "npm start" in the terminal.
